2. Doccument Similarity

3. Dinning Philosopher (Concurrency in Go)

4. T9 in Go

5. Natural Language Calculator

6. Site Critique

7. Kaggle Challenge


I'm likely going to try the Kaggle Challenge (7) and the Site Critique (6) as they are most interesting to me.

For the Kaggle Challenge, I've decided to take on the digit recognization.

The following files are data from the site:
train.csv, test.csv, knn_benchmark.R, knn_benchmark.csv, rf_benchmark.R, rf_benchmark.csv
